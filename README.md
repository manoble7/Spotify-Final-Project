Spotify final project

To Do:

- Drop down menu for bpm input
- Exception if user is not found (users for Spotify)
- Add more playlists to the dictionary
- Add more filters: 
    - Mood
    - Energy 
- Maybe Apple Watch thing where it takes your bpm and gives you the next song (queues a song that matches your bpms or the bpm you want to target)
- Write the ReadMe file
- Handle:
    - Not enough songs for the time specified by user
    - If username doesnâ€™t exist
- Look into if token has expired how to regenerate without having to copy the link all the time
- Add a random option for song genre that picks songs from all playlists as long as a target bpm/range is given
    - Handle exception where no bpm is given
- Toggle buttons for if user wants a range of bpm or a specified bpm
- Check to see what features audio_features() gets for each track
